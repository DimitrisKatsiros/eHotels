<h2> :blue_book: Project Overview </h2>

This project aims to provide a Hotel Managment system, which will allow the users to search and be informed about hotel prices, amenities, as well as to book. Except for user mode, we provided an admin interface as well as a different interface for employees.


This project was started from a Databases assignment for NTUA Course "Databases" (Spring 2017).
